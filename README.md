## Renderfarm Dropped Frame Finder

This script works to look in a specified directory and find which frames were not returned by the farm. It returns the dropped frames in a format that can be pasted directly back into the farm for re-render (i.e. 1-5, 7, 9, 20-21)

Assumes that frame numbers are separated in the film name by '.'.
